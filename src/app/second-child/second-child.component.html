<p>second-child works!</p>

<h2>Exercise 9:</h2>
<p>Here I used the @Output decorator on a "EventEmitter" that was tied to the "consoleFunc"
    <br>function in the parent component. On each button click the function "emitEven()" form the 
    <br>child component would emit an event, this way triggering "ConsoleFunc" in the parent function.
</p>
<button (click)="emitEvent()">Call function in parent component</button>
